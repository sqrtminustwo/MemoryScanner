# Memory Scanner

Pet project **MemoryScanner** to learn how to use C++ for Windows application memory analysis. Two classes are available: `ProcessScanner` and `MemoryScanner`, which do what you would expect them to do.

> **Note:**  
> An example use case is available in [`src/main.cpp`](src/main.cpp).
